## Install Obsidian

2. Install the application

## What's a Vault

A vault is the base directory you will have open in Obsidian. In this directory a `.obsidian` will be made containing your settings and plugins for ***that*** Vault. Choosing or creating the right vault has a major impact on your using pleasure and comfort.  
Tags will not be shared between vaults, autocomplete will not work between vaults, and neither will searches. As vault carries it's own settings and plugins changes in one Vault won't be reflected in another Vault. This makes keeping multiple Vaults and switching between them is cumbersome. You should only use this when you *need* to keep things separated.

***Caution:***

Obsidian recommends not Nesting Vaults as this can be very confusing and break stuff.

Download my demofiles and unpack them in your vault to have some files to play with:  

### Exercise

- [ ] Start Obsidian and create a Vault in your Documents folder. I suggest calling it "Obsidian".
- [ ] Download [Demofiles](assets/Demofiles.zip) to your system.
- [ ] Unpack them and place them in your newly created vault. You now have some content to play around with, with some real-life examples.

### Opening files in your Vault 

Opening files is easily done by navigating through the filebrowser on the left hand side. A quick way to open files, regardless of where they are is using the *Open dialog*.

#### Exercise 2

- [ ] Press `cmd+o` (mac) or `Ctrl+o` (other operating systems)
- [ ] Try typing a letter and read the instructions of the dialog.
- [ ] Try switching between some documents in your vault. Feel free to create extra notes!
