## Templates

The idea of note-taking is that you can start as soon as possible and find speed in the usage. This is tremendously boosted by using Templates in Obsidian. Obsidian let's you insert templates in notes like sniplets. This enables you to not only use complete templates, it also let's you use micro-sniplets which just insert small things, words or code.

### Exercise: Create a `today` or `vandaag` sniplet / template

- [ ] Create a directory in your Vault that will be containing your templates. Example: `/templates`
- [ ] Create a note that will be your template in it and name the note `today`, or `vandaag`, or `today vandaag`.
- [ ] In the note place the following: `{{date}}` and nothing else.
- [ ] Go to `settings` -> *Core plugins* -> `Templates` and set `Template folder location` to the folder you just created (eg `templates`)

Now, let's use the sniplet or template!

- [ ] Open a (new) note.
- [ ] Press cmd+p and type `insert t` to find the *Templates: Insert Template* option and select it.
- [ ] Type a little bit of `today` or `vandaag` to select the right note and press enter.

In this way you've quickly inserted today's date without typing it and looking it up.

Let's speed this up, we'll assign a hotkey:

### Exercise 2

- [ ] Go to `Settings` -> `Hotkeys` and change by using filter:
    - [ ] Press the plus sign behind `Templates: Insert template`
    - [ ] Choose `cmd+shift+i` or something that makes sense to you
    - [ ] Try out using your hotkey!

Notice how much faster using a hotkey is!
