## Linking to documents and headings

The power of a **Vault** is the ability to link to other notes and headings within the Vault with little effort.

You can drag files into a note from the explorer or filebrowser on the side. A more powerful way to do this is to type `[[` and start typing (part of) the name of the note you want to link with.  
Then you can use autocomplete to select the note you want to link to.

### Exercise 1

- [ ] Try linking some notes. Create some notes and folders in order to see how this works. The demofiles in [What's a Vault](Lab%2001%20-%20Installation%20and%20a%20Vault.md#What's%20a%20Vault) should be useful here.
- [ ] Try using heading: Instead of selecting a link to a file, press `#` to select a file and a chapter within.
    - Type `[[` and hover over the file you want to link to.
    - Instead of clicking and selecting the link, press `#`.
    - The menu will change to the heading within the page you are linking to, allowing you to link directly to that heading.
- [ ] For linking to a chapter in note you are editing itself just press `#` right away when you start a new link.

Here lies a mostt of the power of Obsidian. The incoming and outgoing links are easy and quick to make, and easily reviewed in the right sidebar (and below your notes if you enable the setting: `Settings` -> `core plugins` -> `backlinks` -> `backlink in document` )

## Links from outside to your / a Vault

When you have a Todo list / app, you can link from those Todo's directly to a note in your (any) Vault.

### Exercise 2

- [ ] Open a note in your Vault.
- [ ] Use `Cmd+p` (mac) or `Ctrl+p` (others) and type `url`.
- [ ] Select `Copy Obsidian URL`
- [ ] Past the url in a todo task, mail or other app.
- [ ] Close your Obsidian and click the link.
