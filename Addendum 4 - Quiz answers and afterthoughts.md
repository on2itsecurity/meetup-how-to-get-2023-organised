# Addendum 4 - Quiz answers and afterthoughts

## Tips after the Meetup

### Sidebar on the right

Check out the right side-bar, it can show you a lot of nice things:
- Outline of the page (headings)
- All your `#Tags`
- Incoming links
- Outgoing links

## Two main keys in the use of Obsidian

`cmd+p` or `Ctrl+p`: Command selection, this let's you choose an action of Obsidian or any of the plugins you are using.  
`cmd+o` or `Ctrl+o`: Open a note directly.

## Cornell - A simple and popular way to improve on your note-taking

Cornell is a very easy to adopt simple structure which greatly improves your use of your note-taking. [Cornell method in more depth](Addendum%203%20-%20Methods%20of%20Note-taking%20and%20Organizing.md#Cornell%20method%20in%20more%20depth).

## MarkDownload plugin in your browser

With MarkDownload, a plugin available in most browsers, you can copy selections, or entire browsertabs, to markdown and past them in Obsidian.  
This greatly increases the ease of notetaking.

*You can also link this with your vault, so copies go directly into your vault. I don't like this, as the automation just makes things go in your vault somewhere. All that does is giving me something to lookup and cleanup. This only saves me the pasting of the selection where I want it, thus making no sense to me.*

When you enable `Append front/back template to clipped text` this will include the source, so it's including reference.  
I like to change the front-matter to (including trailing empty line):

```
## {pageTitle}

created: {date:YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss} (UTC {date:Z})
source: {baseURI}
author: {byline}

> ## Excerpt
> {excerpt}

---

```

I like to change the back-matter to (including empty line on top):

```

```

## Kahoot questions and answers

1. What are benefits of note-taking?
    - Source (among many): [Austin Community College](https://sites.austincc.edu/student-skills-workshops/taking-effective-notes/benefits-of-notetaking/)
        - Keeps you alert and engages your mind
        - Emphasizes and organizes information
        - Creates a condensed record for study
2. Who started note-taking?
    - Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking)
        - The Ancient Greeks developed [hypomnema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomnema "Hypomnema"), personal records on important subjects.
3. It's more important to put a new note in the correct place then starting to write directly
    - Source: Putting it in practise
        - Put a new note in the root or base of your vault. Maybe don't even name the note: Just be alert in your meeting. When you are done you will have more than time enough and a file to rename and put in the right directory, until your root is empty again.
4. How much time is won by shortcuts / hotkeys?
    - Source: [Lifehack.org](https://www.lifehack.org/561663/wen-shan-how-not-using-keyboard-shortcut-make-you-lose-64-hours-every-year)
        - As discussed in the Meetup: Don't start frantically learning hotkeys. It's work and a dissapointment with keys not used and keys forgotten. I've given you some hotkeys in the Meetup, they are a good starting place. Once you know those, think about something you do all the time and try to put a shortcut key to that. Learn them just one by one, and take all the time you need or want to let it sink in, before you start another.
5. Is there such a thing as a professional note-taking service for day-to-day use?
    - Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking)
        - Professional note-takers provide access to information for people who cannot take their own notes, such as some [deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf "Deaf") and [hearing impaired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impaired "Hearing impaired") people. They most frequently work in [colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges "Colleges") and [universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities "Universities"), but are also used in workplace meetings, appointments, conferences, and training sessions.
6. What are the old folders / directories replaced by?
    - Source: [Forget Folders - The Best Ways to Organize Your Files with Tags and Labels](Addendum%203%20-%20Methods%20of%20Note-taking%20and%20Organizing.md#Forget%20Folders%20-%20The%20Best%20Ways%20to%20Organize%20Your%20Files%20with%20Tags%20and%20Labels)
        - The simple reason being: A note can just go into one folder, but can have many tags which make it easy to find.
7. Which is a popular note taking method?
    - [Cornell method in more depth](Addendum%203%20-%20Methods%20of%20Note-taking%20and%20Organizing.md#Cornell%20method%20in%20more%20depth)
