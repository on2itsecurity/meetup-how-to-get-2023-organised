# Addendum 1 - Recommended Plugins

## Basic and heavily recommended

- Advanced Cursors
    - Multiple cursors at once, and "add next instance to selection" are powerfull tools brought from vscode to  Obsidian by this plugin.
- Advanced Tables
    - Makes working with tables in Markdown easy and intuitive. It will also prettify tables to make working with them a lot more Zen and less messy.
- Autmatically reveal active file
    - When you open a file through a link or through anything else than the filebrowser, this plugin wil show the active file in the filebrowser. This is such a massive timesaver I'm surprised it's not core functionality.
- Copy as HTML
    - Copy your selected Markdown as clean HTML to your clipboard, making it universally usable in other programs as a styled buffer.
- Editor Syntax Highlight
    - Show and recognize code.
- Excel to Markdown Table
    - Convert an Excel clipboard buffer to a Markdown table
- Filename Heading Sync
    - This plugin syncs your H1 heading and your filename in both directions. Very powerfull and usefull. A big timesaver.
- Find orphaned files and broken links
    - With this plugin you can find
        - Unlinked files 
        - Empty files
        - Untagged files
- Local images
    - Local images downloads referenced images for you, and adjusts the note to use those.
- Paste image rename
    - Upon pasting an image, this gives you the option to rename the pasted image, suggesting to name it the same as the note you are writing. If such a picture already exists it will automatically add an increasing number.
- Recent Files
    - It gives you a tab in the left column showing you an ordered list of recently opened files.
- Show Whitespace
    - You can make trailing spaces visible. Especially useful as to spaces ending a sentence is a Markdown linebreak.
- Spaced Repetion
    - A very usefull flashcards study tool via a proven method!
- System Dark Mode
    - Follow your system settings.
- Tag Wrangler
    - With the Tag wrangler you can rename and merge tags from the tag panel.

## Advanced plugins for experienced use

- Kanban
    - A nice plugin that renders a Kanban, while keeping your source just normal checklists. Smart and nifty.
- Linter
    - Linter helps you, like with programming, to automatically correct and change things. I use it to always add a header of meta-data which states when the note was made, when it was modified last, a summary of tags found in the document and the title. This is a handy feature that tells you in an instant what the age of your note is, but also helps in interopability with gohugo, mkdocs and other systems greatly depending on metadata headers.
    - *Knowing what age your note is, is invaluable. Really think about adding this plugin!*
- Tracker
    - A replacement plugin for Charts. Much more capable and nice, with very cool data-source possibilities, which also makes it a bit harder to use initially.
- Rollover Daily Todos
    - When you start micro-blogging in your notes and start putting some tasks in there, this plugin helps you by moving or copying todo's to your new daily note automatically.
- Tasks
    - Uses emitocons in todo's as a nifty way of making them capable of scheduling, deadlines and start dates. A wonderful trick that also doesn't break the specs.
- Vault Statistics
    - Stats! Enough said.
- Waypoint
    - Helps you maintain an automatic index of your notes if you like.
