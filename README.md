## Obsidian labs

These labs will be about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a revolutionary free tool, expandable with plugins and very versatile.

Please work on the labs in your own pace. Ask questions directly and have fun. Each step contains context and explanations.  
The labs will remain online after the Meetup, don't feel rushed if you are running out of time.
