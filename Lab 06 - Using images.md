# Lab 06 - Using images

Being capable of (easily) using images is of tremendous impact on the usefulness of a note-taking tool.

## Exercise:

- [ ] Drag an image from your browser to a note.
- [ ] Copy paste an image using your clipboard.
- [ ] Paste a screenshot with your favorite screenshot tool.

### Download images to your notes using a community plugin

When you select a part of a web page and copy it, images and all, to your notes, most often the images get linked. They work, but they are live displayed from their original location. Downloading and integrating images can be a pain. Luckily there is a plugin that will help you out tremendously.

#### Exercise:

- [ ] Make a new note called `Website notes`
- [ ] Try selecting some parts of [this site](https://on2it.nl/managed-security/) and pasting them in your new note.
- [ ] See how the images work, they are in this format: `![name](url)`
- [ ] Install the community plugin: `Local images`
    - [ ] Go to `Settings` -> `Community plugins`
    - [ ] Turn off `Restricted mode`
    - [ ] Click `Community plugins` - `Browse`
    - [ ] Search for `Local images` and install it.
    - [ ] Enable the plugin `Local images` in `Settings` -> `Community plugins`
    - [ ] Go to `Settings` and select `Local images`.
    - [ ] Make sure `On paste processing` is `disabled`
    - [ ] In `Media folder` enter `assets`
- [ ] Use the plugin to download the images to your note
    - [ ] Use `Ctrl + P` (Windows) or `Command + P` (Mac) to activate the command bar in Obsidian
    - [ ] type `Local images` and select `Download images locally` in the `Website notes` note.
    - [ ] Check out how the images changed. The link parts are local now.
    - [ ] Look in the subfolder `assets` to find the images you just downloaded.
